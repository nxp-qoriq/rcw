/*
 * Work-around for erratum A-050479
 *
 * Problem: PCI Express link training may not be successful during speed change
 *
 * Description:
 * According to the PCI Express base specification, the link training always
 * starts at Gen1 speed. The speed change to the highest mutually-supported
 * speed among both link partners happens immediately after a stable Gen1
 * link is established.

 * Due to this erratum, the default setting of some SerDes registers is not
 * optimal and may cause unsuccessful speed change during the PCI Express link
 * training. For example, if the highest mutually-supported speed among both
 * link partners is Gen2, the speed change from Gen1 to Gen2 may not be
 * successful during the link training. The Gen2 link may down-train to Gen1.
 * The PCI Express controllerâ€™s Link Training and Status State Machine (LTSSM)
 * may remain in the Recovery state for a long time.
 * Sometimes the link may fail to train to Gen2 L0 (Link-up) state


 * Impact:
 * With the default value of some SerDes registers, the speed change of link
 * training may not be successful with the PCI Express link partner.
 *
 * Workaround:
 * Software must implement the following workaround during the Pre-boot
 * Initialization (PBI) stage in order to ensure that the correct SerDes
 * register settings are utilized for a successful PCI Express link training,
 * which happens automatically after the de-assertion of the HRESET_B.
 * Since the PCI Express controllers automatically utilize the settings from
 * these SerDes registers during speed change, software can blindly write to
 * these registers in all SerDes modules without negative impact.
