The RCW directories names for the LA1224rdb boards confirm to the following
naming convention:

abcde_fg_hijk_RR_l_m_n:

a = What is available on ethernet interface 1
b = What is available on ethernet interface 2
c = What is available on ethernet interface 3
d = What is available on ethernet interface 4
e = What is available on ethernet interface 5
f = What is available in Slot 1 (on Serdes 2)
g = What is available in Slot 2 (on Serdes 3)
h = SATA1
i = SATA2
j = SATA3
k = SATA4
m=  
For the Slots (a..k):
 'N' is NULL, not available/not used
 'H' is SATA
 'S' is SGMII
 'P' is PCIe
 'F' is XFI
 'I' is 4 XFI (40G ports used as 4*10G)
 'G' is 25G

RGMII Interface (R):
  'R' is RGMII Interface 1G

Serdes1 protocol (l) in decimal:
l = 'serdes1 protocol value'

Serdes2 protocol (m):
m = 'serdes2 protocol value'

Serdes3 protocol (n):
n = 'serdes3 protocol value'

Ref clock setting on board
==========================
DDR Ref clock: 100 MHz
Sys PLL Ref clock: 100MHz

Files naming convention
=============================
rcw_x_l_m_n.rcw
rcw_x_l_m_n_bootmode.rcw
rcw_x_y_l_m_n.rcw
rcw_x_y_z_l_m_n.rcw

x = Core frequency
y = Platform frequency
z = DDR frequency
bootmode = nor(default)/sd
l = 'serdes1 protocol value'
m = 'serdes2 protocol value'
n = 'serdes3 protocol value'

For example,
  rcw_1900_22_14_3.rcw means rcw for core frequency of 1900MHz, with serdes1=22 serdes2=14 serdes3=3.
  rcw_1900_600_22_14_3.rcw means rcw for core frequency 1900MHz and Platform frequecny 600MHz, with serdes1=22 serdes2=14 serdes3=3.
  rcw_1900_600_2100_22_14_3.rcw means rcw for core frequency 1900MHz, Platform frequecny 600MHz and DDR Memory Data Rate as 2100 MT/s, with serdes1=22 serdes2=14 serdes3=3.

Errata Workaround Implemented
=============================
A-009531:
  The PCI Express controller as the completer sends completion packets with IDO
  bit set in packet header even when the IDO Completion Enable bit is cleared in
  the controller’s Device Control 2 Register.
  Applicable for SNP PCIe controller

A-008851:
  Invalid transmitter/receiver preset values are used in Gen3 equalization
  phases during link training for RC mode
  This errata is valid only for PCI gen3.
  Workaround:
   write 0x00000001 to MISC_CONTROL_1_OFF
   write 0x4747 to Lane Equalization Control register for each lane
  Applicable for SNP PCIe controller

Added GPIO_1 PBI command:

write 0x2300018,0x00000008 : Write on Input Enable buffer resgiter,enable GPIO_1[28] pin
write 0x2300000,0x00000008 : Write on Direction register, output direction of GPIO_1[28] pin
write 0x2300008,0x00000000 : Drive low value on data register of GPIO_1[28] pin
