LA1238-RDB supports 2 serdes, devided into 4 slots.
And slot 2 of serdes block 1 is also disabled.

The RCW directories names for the LA1238MB board conform to the following
naming convention:

abcd_efgh_ijkl_mnop_RR_A_B:

For Serdes1:
a = What is available on serdes 1 slot 1, LANE 0
b = What is available on serdes 1 slot 1, LANE 1
c = What is available on serdes 1 slot 1, LANE 2
d = What is available on serdes 1 slot 1, LANE 3
e = What is available on serdes 1 slot 2, LANE 4
f = What is available on serdes 1 slot 2, LANE 5
g = What is available on serdes 1 slot 2, LANE 6
h = What is available on serdes 1 slot 2, LANE 7

For Serdes2:
i = What is available on serdes 2 slot 3, LANE 0
j = What is available on serdes 2 slot 3, LANE 1
k = What is available on serdes 2 slot 3, LANE 2
l = What is available on serdes 2 slot 3, LANE 3
m = What is available on serdes 2 slot 4, LANE 4
n = What is available on serdes 2 slot 4, LANE 5
o = What is available on serdes 2 slot 4, LANE 6
p = What is available on serdes 2 slot 4, LANE 7

For the Serdes(4 Slots) Lanes (a..x):
 'N' is NULL, not available/not used
 'H' is SATA
 'S' is SGMII
 'P' is PCIe
 'F' is XFI/USXGMII
 'G' is 25G
 'L' is 50G
 'X' is 40G

Serdes1 protocol (A):
A = 'serdes1 protocol value (decimal)'

Serdes2 protocol (B):
B = 'serdes2 protocol value (decimal)'

Ref clock setting on board
==========================
DDR Ref clock: 100 MHz
Sys PLL Ref clock: 100MHz

Files naming convention
=============================
rcw_x_l_m.rcw
rcw_x_l_m_bootmode.rcw
rcw_x_y_l_m.rcw
rcw_x_y_z_l_m.rcw

x = Core frequency
y = Platform frequency
z = DDR frequency
bootmode = nor(default)/sd
l = 'serdes1 protocol value'
m = 'serdes2 protocol value'

For example,
  rcw_2000_3_3.rcw means rcw for core frequency of 2000MHz, with serdes1=3 serdes2=3.
  rcw_2000_650_3_3.rcw means rcw for core frequency 2000MHz and Platform frequecny 650MHz, with serdes1=3 serdes2=3.
  rcw_2000_650_2600_3_3.rcw means rcw for core frequency 2000MHz, Platform frequecny 650MHz and DDR Memory Data Rate as 2600 MT/s, with serdes1=3 serdes2=3.

Reference card connections on different serdes slots (as per serdes protocol)
=============================================================================
Serdes Protocol 3_3:
  Slot1: 10G AQR113 PHY, SFP+
  Slot3: PCIe.3 Gen2 x1 NLM card
  Slot4: PCIe.4 Gen3 x4 LA1238

Errata Workaround Implemented
=============================
A-009531:
  The PCI Express controller as the completer sends completion packets with IDO
  bit set in packet header even when the IDO Completion Enable bit is cleared in
  the controllerâ€™s Device Control 2 Register.
  Applicable for SNP PCIe controller

A-008851:
  Invalid transmitter/receiver preset values are used in Gen3 equalization
  phases during link training for RC mode
  This errata is valid only for PCI gen3.
  Workaround:
   write 0x00000001 to MISC_CONTROL_1_OFF
   write 0x4747 to Lane Equalization Control register for each lane
  Applicable for SNP PCIe controller

A-050479:
  Link Training fails during the Speed-Switch
  Workaround:
   Please program bit 31 of PEX*CR8 to 1'b0 for all PEXs
