LA1238MB supports 2 serdes, devided into 4 slots.
And slot 2 of serdes block 1 is also disabled.

The RCW directories names for the LA1238MB board conform to the following
naming convention:

abcd_efgh_ijkl_mnop_RR_A_B:

For Serdes1:
a = What is available on serdes 1 slot 1, LANE 0
b = What is available on serdes 1 slot 1, LANE 1
c = What is available on serdes 1 slot 1, LANE 2
d = What is available on serdes 1 slot 1, LANE 3
e = What is available on serdes 1 slot 2, LANE 4
f = What is available on serdes 1 slot 2, LANE 5
g = What is available on serdes 1 slot 2, LANE 6
h = What is available on serdes 1 slot 2, LANE 7

For Serdes2:
i = What is available on serdes 2 slot 3, LANE 0
j = What is available on serdes 2 slot 3, LANE 1
k = What is available on serdes 2 slot 3, LANE 2
l = What is available on serdes 2 slot 3, LANE 3
m = What is available on serdes 2 slot 4, LANE 4
n = What is available on serdes 2 slot 4, LANE 5
o = What is available on serdes 2 slot 4, LANE 6
p = What is available on serdes 2 slot 4, LANE 7

For the Serdes(4 Slots) Lanes (a..x):
 'N' is NULL, not available/not used
 'H' is SATA
 'S' is SGMII
 'P' is PCIe
 'F' is XFI/USXGMII
 'G' is 25G
 'L' is 50G
 'X' is 40G

Serdes1 protocol (A):
A = 'serdes1 protocol value (decimal)'

Serdes2 protocol (B):
B = 'serdes2 protocol value (decimal)'

Ref clock setting on board
==========================
DDR Ref clock: 100 MHz
Sys PLL Ref clock: 100MHz

Files naming convention
=============================
rcw_x_l_m.rcw
rcw_x_l_m_bootmode.rcw
rcw_x_y_l_m.rcw
rcw_x_y_z_l_m.rcw

x = Core frequency
y = Platform frequency
z = DDR frequency
bootmode = nor(default)/sd
l = 'serdes1 protocol value'
m = 'serdes2 protocol value'

For example,
  rcw_2000_3_3.rcw means rcw for core frequency of 2000MHz, with serdes1=3 serdes2=3.
  rcw_2000_650_3_3.rcw means rcw for core frequency 2000MHz and Platform frequecny 650MHz, with serdes1=3 serdes2=3.
  rcw_2000_650_2600_3_3.rcw means rcw for core frequency 2000MHz, Platform frequecny 650MHz and DDR Memory Data Rate as 2600 MT/s, with serdes1=3 serdes2=3.

Reference card connections on different serdes slots (as per serdes protocol)
=============================================================================
Serdes Protocol 3_3:
  Slot1: 10G AQR113 PHY, SFP+
  Slot3: PCIe.3 Gen2 x1 NLM card
  Slot4: PCIe.4 Gen3 x4 LA1238

Errata Workaround Implemented
=============================
A-009531:
  The PCI Express controller as the completer sends completion packets with IDO
  bit set in packet header even when the IDO Completion Enable bit is cleared in
  the controller’s Device Control 2 Register.
  Applicable for SNP PCIe controller

A-008851:
  Invalid transmitter/receiver preset values are used in Gen3 equalization
  phases during link training for RC mode
  This errata is valid only for PCI gen3.
  Workaround:
   write 0x00000001 to MISC_CONTROL_1_OFF
   write 0x4747 to Lane Equalization Control register for each lane
  Applicable for SNP PCIe controller

A-050479:
  Link Training fails during the Speed-Switch
  Workaround:
   Please program bit 31 of PEX*CR8 to 1'b0 for all PEXs
