The RCW directories names for the p4080ds board conform to the following 
naming convention:

a_bcde_f:

a = 'R' if RGMII is supported / 'N' if not available/not used

b = What is available in Slot 1
c = What is available in Slot 2
d = What is available in Slot 3
e = What is available in Slot 4

For the Slots (b..e):
 'N' if not available/not used
 'P' if PCIe
 'R' if SRIO
 'S' if SGMII
 'A' is AURORA

f = 'hex value of serdes protocol value'

So R_NSSP_0x06 means:
 - RGMII is enabled
 - Nothing on Slot 1
 - SGMII on Slot 2
 - SGMII on Slot 3
 - PCI on Slot 4

and the SERDES Protocol is 0x06.

for P3060QDS board:
SERDES PROTOCOL = 0x06 -> 8g, 2x RGMII + 2x SGMII(slot1) + 2x SGMII(slot2) + 2x SGMII(slot3)
