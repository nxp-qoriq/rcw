The RCW directories names for the LX2160A HPCSOM board conform to the following
naming convention:

abcdefgh_ijklmnop_RR_q_r_s:

a = What is available on Serdes1 Lane0
b = What is available on Serdes1 Lane1
c = What is available on Serdes1 Lane2
d = What is available on Serdes1 Lane3
e = What is available on Serdes1 Lane4
f = What is available on Serdes1 Lane5
g = What is available on Serdes1 Lane6
h = What is available on Serdes1 Lane7

i = What is available on Serdes2 Lane0
j = What is available on Serdes2 Lane1
k = What is available on Serdes2 Lane2
l = What is available on Serdes2 Lane3
m = What is available on Serdes2 Lane4
n = What is available on Serdes2 Lane5
o = What is available on Serdes2 Lane6
p = What is available on Serdes2 Lane7

Serdes3 is unused.

For Serdes lanes (a..p):
 'N' is NULL, not available/not used
 'H' is SATA
 'S' is SGMII
 'P' is PCIe
 'F' is XFI
 'I' is 4 XFI (40G ports used as 4*10G)
 'G' is 25G
 'L' is 50G
 'X' is 40G
 'C' is 100G

RGMII Interface (R):
  'R' is RGMII Interface 1G

Serdes1 protocol (q) in decimal:
q = 'serdes1 protocol value'

Serdes2 protocol (r):
r = 'serdes2 protocol value'

Serdes3 protocol (s):
s = 'serdes3 protocol value'

Ref clock setting on board
==========================
DDR Ref clock: 100 MHz
Sys PLL Ref clock: 100MHz

Files naming convention
=============================
rcw_x_q_r_s.rcw
rcw_x_q_r_s_bootmode.rcw
rcw_x_y_q_r_s.rcw
rcw_x_y_z_q_r_s.rcw

x = Core frequency
y = Platform frequency
z = DDR frequency
bootmode = emmc(default)/sd
q = 'serdes1 protocol value'
r = 'serdes2 protocol value'
s = 'serdes3 protocol value'

For example,
  rcw_2000_1_10_0.rcw means rcw for core frequency of 2000MHz, with serdes1=1 serdes2=10 serdes3=0.
  rcw_2000_700_1_10_0.rcw means rcw for core frequency 2000MHz and Platform frequecny 700MHz, with serdes1=1 serdes2=10 serdes3=0.
  rcw_2000_700_2400_1_10_0.rcw means rcw for core frequency 2000MHz, Platform frequecny 700MHz and DDR Memory Data Rate as 2400 MT/s, with serdes1=1 serdes2=10 serdes3=0.
  rcw_2000_1_10_0_sd.rcw means rcw for core frequency of 2000MHz with SD boot, with serdes1=1 serdes2=10 serdes3=0.

Errata Workaround Implemented
=============================
A-009531:
  The PCI Express controller as the completer sends completion packets with IDO
  bit set in packet header even when the IDO Completion Enable bit is cleared in
  the controllerâ€™s Device Control 2 Register.
  Applicable for SNP PCIe controller

A-008851:
  Invalid transmitter/receiver preset values are used in Gen3 equalization
  phases during link training for RC mode
  This errata is valid only for PCI gen3.
  Workaround:
   write 0x00000001 to MISC_CONTROL_1_OFF
   write 0x4747 to Lane Equalization Control register for each lane
  Applicable for SNP PCIe controller

A-050479:
  Link Training fails during the Speed-Switch
  Workaround:
   Please program bit 31 of PEX*CR8 to 1'b0 for all PEXs
